This is summary of concurrency in Golang for personal learning.

# What is concurrency?

Concurrency means doing many things at once.
Golang supports concurrent execution.

This is different from parallelism. Parallelism is not always fast, because in many cases processes need to communicate with each other during processing.

Let us take a look at some descriptions and examples. 

# 1. Goroutines

# 2. Channels

# 3. Buffered channels

# 4. Worker pools

# 5. Select

# 6. Mutex
