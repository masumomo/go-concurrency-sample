This is summary of concurrency in Golang for personal learning.

# What is concurrency?

Concurrency is to deal with a lot of thing at once.
Golang supports concurrent execution.

It's different from parallelism. Parallelism is not always fast because, in many cases, the processes have to communicate with each other during processing.

Let's take a look at some descriptions and examples. 

# 1. Goroutines

# 2. Channels

# 3. Buffered channels

# 4. Worker pools

# 5. Select

# 6. Mutex
